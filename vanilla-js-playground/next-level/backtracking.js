// Backtracking is a method to solve problems by making a series of choices that we can return or backtrack to

// the call stack "remembers" our choices and "knows" what to choose next

// 3 KEYS
    // 1. Our Choice 
        // What choice do we make at each call of the function?
        // recursion expresses decision
    // 2. Our Constraints
        // When do we stop following a certain path?
        // When do we not waste time and attempt a certain option
    // 3. Our goal
        // What's our target?
        // What are we trying to find?
